# Homogeneous Coordinates

find centers of subtriangles that are bounded by the lines from the point to the 3 vertices. Here the function is written in F# which can be run via 
```fsi Script.fsx``` and it outputs incenters, circumcenters, orthocenters for each subtriangle

equivalent code written in SQL making a table of points, a table of triangles

here is a pdf explaining barycentric coordinates written for an olympiad geometry audience

#### TO DO
convert from subtriangles coordinate system to the equilateral parent triangle's coordinate system
