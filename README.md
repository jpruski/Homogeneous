# Homogeneous Coordinates

find centers of subtriangles that are bounded by the lines from the point to the 3 vertices, here the function is written in F# and it can be sun via 
```fsi Script.fsx```

here is a pdf explaining barycentric coordinates written for an olympiad geometry audience

#### TO DO
convert from subtriangles coordinate system to the equilateral parent triangle's coordinate system
